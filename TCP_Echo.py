'''
Sockets can be configured to act as a server and listen for incoming messages, 
or connect to other applications as a client. After both ends of a TCP/IP socket 
are connected, communication is bi-directional.


This sample program, based on the one in the standard library documentation, 
receives incoming messages and echos them back to the sender. It starts by 
creating a TCP/IP socket.

'''

import socket
import sys

# Create a TCP/IP socket
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

'''
Then bind() is used to associate the socket with the server address. 
In this case, the address is localhost, referring to the current server, 
and the port number is 10000.
'''



# Bind the socket to the port
server_address = ('localhost', 10000)
print >>sys.stderr, 'starting up on %s port %s' % server_address
sock.bind(server_address)

'''
Calling listen() puts the socket into server mode, and accept() 
waits for an incoming connection.
'''

# Listen for incoming connections
sock.listen(1)

while True:
    # Wait for a connection
    print >>sys.stderr, 'waiting for a connection'
    connection, client_address = sock.accept()

'''
accept() returns an open connection between the server and client, 
along with the address of the client. The connection is actually a 
different socket on another port (assigned by the kernel). 
Data is read from the connection with recv() and transmitted with sendall().
'''

try:
    print >>sys.stderr, 'connection from', client_address

    # Receive the data in small chunks and retransmit it
    while True:
        data = connection.recv(16)
        print >>sys.stderr, 'received "%s"' % data
        if data:
            print >>sys.stderr, 'sending data back to the client'
            connection.sendall(data)
        else:
            print >>sys.stderr, 'no more data from', client_address
            break
        
finally:
    # Clean up the connection
    connection.close()
